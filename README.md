Prototype created for off-campus housing website for San Jose Students. 


San Jose students can find the apartments and condominiums according to their needs and can also sometimes find the sublets. Students can find the property from the map which is integrated at the bottom of each property page and can also rate the property. 
Website was developed using PHP,Curl,MySql as backend and HTML 5.0, CSS 3.0 and bootstrap as frontend.
